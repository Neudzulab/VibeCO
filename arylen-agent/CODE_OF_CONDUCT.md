# Code of Conduct

We aim to build an inclusive, respectful community. All participants must:

- Communicate professionally and avoid personal attacks.
- Value different perspectives and encourage collaboration.
- Refrain from harassment, discrimination, or disruptive conduct.
- Follow confidentiality and security guidelines.

Report violations to `@Neudzulab` and the project lead. Incidents will be reviewed promptly and handled with appropriate actions.
