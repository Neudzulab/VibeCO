# VibeCO Agent Guidelines

Welcome! This repository does not originally ship with an `AGENTS.md`, so this file establishes the default conventions for any
contributor-facing agent instructions that might be added to downstream projects.

## General principles
- **VibeCO directives take precedence.** When integrating these guidelines into another project that already has its own `AGENTS.md`, merge the two but defer to the VibeCO principles whenever the instructions conflict.
- **Scope-aware updates.** If you introduce additional `AGENTS.md` files inside subdirectories, make sure their instructions only narrow or extend the guidance that applies within that subtree. Never contradict a parent `AGENTS.md` without explicitly documenting the override.
- **Always leave a visible trail.** Every meaningful edit must be traceable through a file-level header note, a README architecture/tree adjustment, and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

## Mandatory contribution checklist (repository-wide)

These requirements apply to *every* change unless a more specific sub-directory `AGENTS.md` overrides them.

1. **File headers:**
   - Prepend an explanatory comment block to the top of any file you create or substantially modify.
   - Use the native comment style for the language/format (e.g., `#` for Python, `<!-- -->` for Markdown, YAML comments for configs).
   - Minimum content: purpose of the file/module and, if relevant, the latest change summary. Skip only when the format does not support comments (e.g., binary assets).
2. **README architecture tree:**
   - Whenever you add, rename, or remove endpoints, services, or notable directories, update the architecture tree in `README.md` so it remains an exact reflection of the repository structure.
   - Include new endpoints/services as nested bullets beneath their owning component, noting status (planned/in-progress/complete) when not yet shipped.
3. **CHANGELOG discipline:**
   - Log every change under the appropriate heading in `CHANGELOG.md` using the existing semantic versioning cadence.
   - Mention affected files or components plus any README/roadmap adjustments so reviewers can audit coverage quickly.
4. **Roadmap alignment:**
   - Review both `PLAN.md` and the `Roadmap` section in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` during each change.
   - If the work influences scope, schedule, or owners, update the relevant entries immediately and note the update in the changelog.
5. **Agent guide sync:**
   - When adding new directories or conventions, extend this root `AGENTS.md` or add a scoped guide beside the change.
   - Document any deviations from the checklist explicitly so the next contributor does not have to guess the rules.

> **Audit tip:** Before finalising a commit, run `git status -s` and verify that any file appearing in the diff is covered by steps 1–4 above. Missing any step should block the submission.

## Authoring `AGENTS.md` files in other projects
1. Start by copying the sections in this file as a baseline template.
2. Add project-specific tips that explain:
   - How the project is structured (key directories, modules, or scripts).
   - Coding or documentation conventions that are unique to the project.
   - Any testing, linting, or build commands that should be run before submitting changes.
3. Highlight non-obvious requirements—for example environment variables, data files, or external services—that the agent must prepare before running tests.
4. If existing `AGENTS.md` files already contain instructions, preserve them and append VibeCO directives. Clarify the precedence order so future agents understand which rules dominate.

## Continuing an `AGENTS.md` update
When someone asks for "AGENTS.md devam" (to continue agent instructions), follow this triage order before writing any new guidance:
1. **Collect the current state.** Read every `AGENTS.md` from repository root to the target directory to understand inherited rules and spot conflicts early.
2. **Prioritize top-level gaps.** Resolve repository-wide issues first (naming conventions, versioning, shared tooling). Only after those are addressed should you refine nested instructions.
3. **Map orphan structures.** List directories, modules, or workflows that lack coverage from any existing `AGENTS.md`. Note whether they need fresh guidance or if they can inherit from parents.
4. **Detect inconsistencies.** Flag mismatched terminology, divergent naming conventions, or contradictory process steps. Capture each discrepancy with a proposed resolution.
5. **Confirm with the requester.** Share your findings (orphan list, conflict matrix, proposed fixes) and request a `clarification.yaml` file from the user only when a concrete decision between clearly identified options must be locked in. Do not pause other actionable work while waiting—collect the clarification in parallel with ongoing tasks.

### Requesting `clarification.yaml`
Ask the requester to fill in a clarification YAML with the following structure whenever the team is genuinely split between well-defined alternatives:
```yaml
decision_context: "Gateway service port selection"
options:
  - value: 5005
    rationale: "Matches existing staging traffic configuration"
  - value: 5020
    rationale: "Aligns with production firewall rules"
selected_option: 5005
follow_up_tasks:
  - "Update gateway deployment manifests"
additional_notes: |
  Add any contextual details that affect how the instructions should be finalized. Limit requests to the specific fork-in-the-road you are addressing right now.
```
Wait for a complete response before finalizing the instructions relevant to that choice, but continue progressing on other independent workstreams.

> **Usage guardrails:**
> - Keep requests situational—each `clarification.yaml` should map to a single decision point rather than a general status update.
> - If the requester provides both options (e.g., `5005` and `5020`), pick the option they highlighted as the final decision and document it before moving forward.
> - Avoid serial requests that block the project; only ask for the file when you can list the competing options and the downstream change that depends on the answer.

## Documenting resolutions
- Summarize accepted solutions directly in the relevant `AGENTS.md` scopes and link to the authoritative `clarification.yaml` when possible.
- Keep a running changelog inside the file (or the project CHANGELOG) describing how orphaned areas were addressed, which conventions won, and any open follow-ups.
- Whenever you introduce clarifications, annotate why VibeCO precedence applies so future maintainers know which directives cannot be overridden.

## VibeCO usage directives
- Prefer VibeCO-native tools (such as `make`, `scripts/` helpers, or `project.yaml` configurations) when interacting with the project.
- When documenting workflows in future `AGENTS.md` files, link to any relevant VibeCO documentation under `docs/` or `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` so that maintainers can easily trace the rationale behind the instructions.
- Encourage contributors to keep `AGENTS.md` in sync with code changes—especially when new directories, commands, or automation steps are introduced.

Feel free to adapt this template to match the needs of each project while keeping these principles front and center.
