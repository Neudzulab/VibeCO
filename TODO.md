# Agent TODO Tracker

- [ ] Establish a cadence for reviewing and updating `TODO.md` so agents prioritise the backlog before other tasks.
- [ ] Backfill active initiatives from `PLAN.md` and `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` into this tracker with owners and sequencing notes.
- [ ] Define the update protocol that inserts new developments beneath unfinished items or alongside related tasks without
      reordering completed work.
- [ ] Prepare the orchestration rules for adding efficiency-focused TODOs as soon as earlier entries close to avoid idle periods.
