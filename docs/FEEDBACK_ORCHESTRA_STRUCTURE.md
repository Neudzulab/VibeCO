# Feedback Orchestra Team Structure

## 1. Purpose and Scope
- Establish a feedback loop that strengthens project decisions, customer experience, and investor confidence during alpha, beta, pre-launch, and post-launch phases.
- Evaluate data from customer panel users, internal staff, investors, partners, business consultants, and marketing teams holistically.
- Ground every recommendation in tangible evidence and turn it into an actionable, measurable plan.

## 2. Stakeholder Segments and Roles
| Segment | Role | Engagement Start | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Customer Panel Users** | Primary external user voice | Alpha preparation | Report on user journeys, usage challenges, and contribute to prioritizing recommendations. |
| **Internal Staff** | Operational feedback providers | Project kickoff | Surface feasibility insights, share technical/operational risks, execute test plans. |
| **Partners** | Ecosystem alignment advisors | Alpha kickoff | Provide integration requirements, partner customer expectations, joint marketing opportunities. |
| **Investors** | Strategic reviewers and vision providers | Beta preparation | Validate KPI targets, offer risk management guidance, communicate ROI expectations. |
| **Business Consultants** | Process optimization experts | Alpha phase | Advise on regulatory compliance, operational efficiency, scalability. |
| **Marketing Team** | Market voice and communication strategists | Beta kickoff | Run message testing, positioning, and optimize launch plans. |

## 3. Phase-Based Participation and Focus Areas
1. **Project Kickoff (T-16 weeks)**
   - Core team: Product lead, operations lead, technical lead, data analyst.
   - "Core hypothesis" workshop with internal staff and consultants.
   - Output: Prioritized assumptions, MVP scope, metrics framework.
2. **Pre-Alpha (T-12 weeks)**
   - Select customer panel candidates and finalize NDAs.
   - Conduct integration pre-work with partners.
   - Investor briefing memo covering target metrics and risks.
3. **Alpha Phase (T-8 → T-4 weeks)**
   - Weekly "Feedback Orchestra" meetings.
   - Task-based testing for users and staff (usage scenarios, task-based testing).
   - Recommendation scoring matrix (Impact, Feasibility, Evidence level).
4. **Beta Phase (T-4 → T-1 weeks)**
   - Marketing message tests (A/B, concept tests).
   - Investor panel: financial simulations and risk assessment.
   - Partner pilots: integration validation reports.
5. **Launch and Post-Launch (T0 → T+8 weeks)**
   - Daily early warning dashboard (performance, customer support, SLA).
   - Bi-weekly retros with all segments.
   - Lessons-learned report and backlog refresh.

## 4. Recommendation Evaluation Process
1. **Collection**
   - Channels: Surveys (Likert), structured interviews, customer usage analytics, support tickets, investor/partner session notes.
   - Minimum data set per recommendation: Problem definition, observed impact, proposed solution, supporting evidence.
2. **Pre-Screening (48 hours)**
   - Product lead and data analyst apply the "tangibility checklist":
     - Is it tied to a measurable metric?
     - Is it a recurring signal (≥3 independent sources)?
     - Can it be tested with a hypothesis-driven approach?
3. **Test Design (1 week)**
   - Applicable test types: Usability testing, A/B testing, cohort analysis, financial modeling, operational pilots.
   - Success criteria: Effect size, defect reduction, satisfaction lift, cost/ROI indicators.
4. **Scoring and Prioritization**
   - Scorecard: `Impact (1-5) × Evidence Level (1-5) × Feasibility (1-5)`.
   - Recommendations below the threshold enter the backlog as "under observation."
   - Fast-track items for recommendations scoring above 80.
5. **Decision and Action**
   - Bi-weekly decision forum moderated by the orchestra lead.
   - RACI chart and due dates for approved actions.
   - Archive test results and decision rationale in Confluence/Notion.

## 5. Organization and Governance Model
- **Orchestra Lead (Program Manager)**: Owns end-to-end orchestration, plans meetings, consolidates reporting.
- **Product Owner**: Manages backlog updates and delivery tracking.
- **Data Analyst**: Designs measurement, validates data, maintains metric dashboards.
- **Customer Researcher**: Prepares interview guides and manages the panel.
- **Partner Relations Lead**: Coordinates partner and investor sessions.
- **Marketing Lead**: Runs message tests and manages launch content.

### Meeting Cadence
| Frequency | Meeting | Participants | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | Operational Sync | Core team + relevant stakeholders | Test status updates and risks. |
| Bi-weekly | Decision Forum | Orchestra lead, product owner, data analyst, investor representative | Recommendation scores and action decisions. |
| Monthly | Strategy Review | Executive team, marketing, partner leads | Roadmap alignment and resource planning. |

## 6. Measurement and Reporting
- **Metrics**
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS), Task Completion Time, Defect rate, Support ticket volume.
  - Financial: CAC/LTV projection, investor satisfaction score.
  - Internal process: SLA adherence, action completion rate.
- **Reporting Tools**: BI dashboard (Looker/Power BI), weekly summary emails, monthly investor reports.
- **Traceability**: Unique ID, test results, and decision log for every recommendation.

## 7. Risk Management and Control Points
- Provide clear incentives (panel rewards, knowledge sharing) to sustain stakeholder engagement.
- Uphold data privacy and contracts: NDAs, data processing agreements, access control lists.
- Maintain a two-week "agile sprint" buffer to absorb unexpected outcomes.

## 8. Communication Plan
- **Internal Communications**: Slack channel set (#feedback-orchestra, #test-results), weekly notes.
- **External Communications**: Panel newsletters, investor briefings, partner roadshows.
- **Escalation Mechanism**: Escalate critical risks to leadership within 24 hours.

## 9. Starter Roadmap (Example)
| Week | Activity | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-16 | Appoint orchestra lead, form core team | Organization chart, charter. |
| T-14 | Draft tangibility checklist and scorecard | Approved process document. |
| T-12 | Select panelists and partners, finalize NDAs | Participant list. |
| T-10 | Build alpha test plan and measurement stack | Test plan, dashboard template. |
| T-8  | Launch alpha, capture first data | Weekly report 1. |
| T-4  | Prepare beta, run marketing tests | Beta report, marketing recommendations. |
| T-1  | Run launch rehearsal, investor update | Launch checklist. |
| T+2 | Conduct post-launch retro, refresh backlog | Lessons-learned report. |

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- Quarterly process audit: KPI performance, stakeholder feedback, methodology updates.
- Experiment design knowledge base: Catalog test results for reuse.
- Training program: Onboarding guide for new participants and data literacy sessions.

## 11. Team Culture and Knowledge Management
- **Team Culture Journal**: Capture narratives on "how we worked best," challenges, and solutions at the end of each sprint to preserve behavioral insights, rituals, and communication patterns.
- **Know-How Ledger**: Document new approaches or tools along with test results and implementation steps. Always include title, date, owner, and relevant metrics.
- **Approval Flow**: Orchestra lead and subject-matter expert validate new entries within 48 hours. Plan extra tests if needed and link outcomes to the ledger.
- **Access and Versioning**: Maintain the knowledge base with version control in a shared tool (Notion, Confluence). Log change notes and reference test IDs for every update.
- **Onboarding for New Members**: Review the culture journal and know-how ledger as part of onboarding so newcomers quickly absorb previous learnings.
- **Corporate Treasury Mindset**: Treat recorded knowledge as intellectual capital. Define access policies that protect critical information while encouraging team-wide sharing.
