# Know-How Ledger Strategy

## 1. Purpose
- Turn technical and operational knowledge into institutional memory.
- Help new members ramp up quickly.
- Increase cross-orchestra learning flow with reusable solutions.

## 2. Scope
| Orchestra | Priority | Know-How Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feedback Orchestra | High | Test results, recommendation scorecards, metric dashboards |
| Core Product Orchestra | High | Code standards, architectural decision records |
| Growth Orchestra | Medium | Experiment setup guides, channel optimization |
| Operations Orchestra | Medium | SOPs, automation scripts |
| Support Orchestra | Medium | Macro templates, case escalation playbooks |

## 3. Execution Cycle
1. **Record**
   - Log new technical solutions or process improvements within 48 hours.
   - Template fields: Title, date, owner, context (story/epic ID), solution steps, test results, reusability level.
2. **Validate**
   - The subject-matter expert and orchestra lead assign an "Approved / Needs Iteration" status within 72 hours.
   - Plan additional experiments or measurements if needed, and update the record accordingly.
3. **Classify and Share**
   - Taxonomy: Domain (product, data, infrastructure, operations), impact (performance, quality, cost), keywords.
   - Weekly "knowledge discovery" session: Share new records and plan cross-orchestra transfers.

## 4. Measurement
- Number of records reused by other orchestras.
- Completion rate of the automatic "review" task for records older than 90 days.
- Hours saved per sprint to measure how know-how entries accelerate projects.

## 5. Integration Links
- Configure a bidirectionally linked database with the knowledge management area in the integration roadmap.
- Set up API integrations with the issue tracker and test dashboards so records update automatically.
- Send notifications for new or updated know-how records to the #orchestra-learning channel via the Slack integration.

## 6. Training and Onboarding
- Week 1: Know-how ledger quick-start guide.
- Month 1: Assignment to create a know-how record with mentor support.
- Ongoing: Present the three most impactful know-how entries during quarterly share-out days.

## 7. Continuous Improvement
- Evaluate the ledger's effectiveness during the quarterly "knowledge ecosystem" retrospective.
- Measure discoverability with NLP and search analytics, and refresh underperforming tags.
- Regularly add new technologies, rituals, and metrics to the ledger; retire unused templates.
