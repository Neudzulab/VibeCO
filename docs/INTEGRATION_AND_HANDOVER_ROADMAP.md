# Integration and Handover Roadmap

## 1. Purpose
- Manage culture journal and know-how ledger entries from a single source of truth.
- Systematize integration needs and technology choices when taking over unfinished projects.
- Accelerate knowledge sharing across orchestras.

## 2. Knowledge Management Integration
- Maintain culture and know-how records within a linked database inside the shared knowledge management area.
- Build bi-directional, API-based connections with Jira/Linear, test dashboards, and metric systems.
- Push automatic notifications of new or updated records to the #orchestra-learning Slack channel.
- Run a monthly data pull to report correlations between culture-behavior metrics and KPI performance.

## 3. Training and Onboarding Scenarios
- Week 1: Guided session highlighting critical aspects of culture and know-how records for new team members.
- Month 1: Mentor-supported assignment to contribute to both the culture journal and the know-how ledger.
- Ongoing: Quarterly knowledge-sharing day featuring the three most impactful culture insights and know-how entries.

## 4. Unfinished Project Handover Plan
### 4.1 First 10-Day Review
| Day | Activity | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 | Current-state briefing, stakeholder mapping | Stakeholder list, communication plan |
| 3-4 | Codebase and architecture discovery | System diagram, critical dependencies |
| 5-6 | Process and cadence analysis (rituals, decision mechanisms) | Cadence assessment notes |
| 7 | Culture journal & know-how ledger review | Prior learnings list |
| 8-9 | Open backlog and goal review | Prioritized goals table |
| 10 | Risk and opportunity assessment | Risk matrix, acceleration proposals |

### 4.2 Strategy and Roadmap Development
1. **Assessment Report**
   - Analyze the pros and cons of the current programming language (performance, team expertise, ecosystem support).
   - Produce short-, mid-, and long-term cost models for alternative languages/technologies.
   - List technical debt and critical modules that must be completed.
2. **Decision Points**
   - Continue: If advantage score (performance + team expertise + integration ease) ≥ 7/10, stay with the current language.
   - Transition: If the advantage score is low and migration cost ≤ 1.5× projected MVP completion cost, plan a refactor or rewrite.
   - Rebuild: If technical debt/scale risk is critical (SEV-1) and migration cost < 2×, opt for a new architecture.
3. **Sprint-Based Roadmap**
   - `Sprint 1`: Close security vulnerabilities and critical bugs.
   - `Sprint 2`: Execute foundational architectural fixes and set up automation pipelines.
   - `Sprint 3`: Finish missing modules and run integrated tests.
   - `Sprint 4`: Optimize performance and complete user acceptance testing.
   - Document learnings in the culture journal and know-how ledger every sprint.

### 4.3 Management and Communication Rituals
- Weekly status meeting covering risks, progress, and decision needs.
- Bi-weekly strategy review to reassess alternative language options and cost models.
- Monthly stakeholder demo showcasing orchestra vision, goal progress, and shared learnings.
- Dedicated culture journal section: "What we learned after the handover."

## 5. Success Metrics
| Area | Metric | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Culture Journal | Participation rate | ≥ 85% |
| Culture Journal | Insights turned into action | ≥ 2 per sprint |
| Know-How Ledger | New records | ≥ 3 per week |
| Know-How Ledger | Reuse rate | ≥ 30% |
| Project Handover | Time to close critical risks | ≤ 2 sprints |
| Project Handover | MVP completion variance | ≤ 10% |

## 6. Continuous Improvement
- Run a quarterly "knowledge ecosystem" retrospective to review integration processes and handover rituals.
- Automate analysis: sentiment analysis for culture journals, impact analysis and trend reports for know-how entries.
- Conduct annual external benchmarks with similarly sized teams.
- Update standards with new technologies and rituals; retire low-usage areas as needed.
