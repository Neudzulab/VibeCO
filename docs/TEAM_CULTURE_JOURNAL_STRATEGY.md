# Team Culture Journal Strategy

## 1. Purpose
- Make learning and behavioral signals across orchestras visible, measurable, and shareable.
- Keep team rituals and values up to date and anchored in institutional memory.
- Ensure culture insights feed sprint planning and decision-making processes.

## 2. Scope
| Orchestra | Priority | Culture Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feedback Orchestra | High | Stakeholder synchronization rituals, decision transparency |
| Core Product Orchestra | High | Sprint retro insights, customer empathy |
| Growth Orchestra | Medium | Experimentation culture, rapid iteration principles |
| Operations Orchestra | Medium | Shift rituals, crisis scenario drills |
| Support Orchestra | Medium | Empathy and resolution rituals |

## 3. Implementation Cycle
1. **Ritual Design**
   - Add a 30-minute "Culture Retrospective" session to every sprint close.
   - Session outputs: "When we worked best," "Where we struggled," "Let's try next sprint."
2. **Documentation**
   - Template fields: Date, sprint name, participants, narrative section (max 500 words), behavioral signal tags (#trust, #transparency, #focus, etc.).
   - Storage: Shared knowledge management tool such as Notion or Confluence, plus a monthly PDF archive.
3. **Ownership and Governance**
   - The orchestra lead is responsible for moderation and publishing.
   - The People and Culture representative standardizes tags and facilitates cross-orchestra benchmarking.

## 4. Measurement
- Participation rate, number of insights turned into action, correlation with team NPS.
- Quarterly trend analysis on changes in behavioral signals (e.g., % change in notes tagged #transparency).
- Tracking status of action items derived from culture journals.

## 5. Integration Links
- Sync journal entries automatically with the knowledge management area in the integration roadmap.
- Send notifications for new culture entries to the #orchestra-learning Slack channel.
- Establish two-way links with sprint planning tools (Jira, Linear) to log related epic/story references.

## 6. Training and Onboarding
- Week 1: "Highlights" tour of the culture journal for new members.
- Month 1: Mentor-supported assignment to create a personal culture insight entry.
- Ongoing: Share the three most impactful culture insights during the quarterly knowledge sharing day.

## 7. Continuous Improvement
- Evaluate journal effectiveness through the quarterly "culture ecosystem" retrospective.
- Generate trend reports with NLP-powered sentiment analysis and share the findings.
- Review unused template fields annually and retire them if necessary.
- Partner with the Agent Honor Roll Program to spotlight culture journal highlights; entries that demonstrate exceptional teamwork
